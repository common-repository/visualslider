Adds a simple & lightweight Lightbox to the standard WordPress Gallery and Image Block. 

== Description ==

Lightbox For WordPress Core Default Gallery Block

The VisualSlider plugin will add cherry on top of the WordPress core default gallery by enabling the lightbox.

The core new WordPress comes with the block building editing experience, which has a default gallery block. VisualSlide will add the lightbox effect to that gallery. No extra setting or configuration is needed. Just active and play.

The VisualSlide will not add any extra block or gallery, it will work as an extension or modifier for the WordPress default block editor. VisualSlide can be de-activated anytime and the already created gallery will work just like it was working without VisualSlide. Without VisualSlide WordPress Gallery Block will appear with the default behavior.

VisualSlide has one and only one settings to configure in order to make it work. By navigating Gallery Block Settings settings from the individual image, it's required to choose **Media File** for the **Link To** Dropdown.
